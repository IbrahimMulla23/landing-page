<h1>Hello World</h1>

<h3>What is Football?</h3>
<p>Football is the most popular sport in the world and sees opposing teams of 11 players try to score goals primarily by use of the feet.</p>
<h4>What are the rules of Football?</h4>
<p>Two teams of 11 players each try to place the ball into a goal by using any part of their anatomy with the exception of the hand or arm.</br>
    Players must not be overly physical in their attempts to win the ball, and a mistimed challenge, eg. kicking the opposing player before the ball, will lead to a free-kick to the opposition. This can be a penalty (spot-kick) if the 'foul' occurs in the player's own penalty area.</br> 
    Each team has a goalkeeper who is permitted to handle the ball only inside their own penalty area. If they are outside the area, they are considered as an outfield player.</br></p>
